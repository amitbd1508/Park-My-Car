## **Project Description :**

In our country private car parking is a known problem . We do not have public parking facility so that everyone park their car beside the road. As a result the road ar fully jam and there are no space for driving .

It will be better if we can park our car in a nearest place  for a short time.

Most of our building parking  is empty in office time . So we can rent it and make some money as well as we can solve the parking problem .

So i come up a solution called &quot;Park My Car&quot;. Using this you can share your parking area with other and user can directly see your parking facility and request you park their car for some hours .
